- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeded

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Test ingredient input
- [ ] Test preference selection
- [ ] Generate a recipe (IMPORTANT: This uses real API credits)
- [ ] Save a recipe
- [ ] Reload page - verify saved recipe persists
- [ ] Test on mobile device

- [ ] Review error reports regularly

## Security

### API Keys
- [ ] âœ… `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] âœ… No API keys in code
- [ ] âœ… Environment variables used correctly
- [ ] API key stored securely in Vercel

### Dependencies
- [ ] All dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Trusted packages only

## Optional Enhancements

### Custom Domain
- [ ] Domain purchased
- [ ] DNS configured
- [ ] Domain added to Vercel project
- [ ] SSL certificate active (automatic with Vercel)

### Analytics

- [ ] Favicon updated
- [ ] sitemap.xml generated

### Features
- [ ] Recipe sharing functionality
- [ ] User authentication (if planned)
- [ ] Database integration (if replacing localStorage)
- [ ] Additional AI features

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or issues are found:

1. [ ] Vercel allows instant rollback to previous deployment
2. [ ] Click "Rollback" in deployment dashboard
3. [ ] Investigate issues locally
4. [ ] Fix and redeploy

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- âœ… Production URL loads without errors
- âœ… Users can generate recipes
- âœ… Recipes can be saved and retrieved
- âœ… Mobile experience is smooth
- âœ… API costs are within budget
- âœ… No critical errors in logs

## Post-Launch

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor error logs daily
- [ ] Track API usage
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Fix critical bugs immediately

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Review usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize based on real data
- [ ] Consider feature additions
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### Ongoing
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI for new models
- [ ] Improve based on user feedback
- [ ] Consider monetization (if applicable)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Vercel environment variables and redeploy

### Build fails on Vercel
**Solution**: Check build logs, ensure all dependencies in package.json, verify Node.js version compatibility

### Recipe generation is slow
**Solution**: Normal for GPT-4 (5-10 seconds). Consider adding better loading feedback or using GPT-3.5-turbo for faster responses

### LocalStorage not working
**Solution**: Ensure browser allows localStorage, check for private/incognito mode

### Mobile sidebar not opening
**Solution**: Check z-index conflicts, verify Tailwind responsive classes
